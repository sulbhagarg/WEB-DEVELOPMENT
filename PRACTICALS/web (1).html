		<p align='justify'>In computer science, a data structure is a data organization, management, and storage format that enables efficient access and modification.More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.</p><br>
		
		<a name = "Usage">
		<h3 style="color:#32cd32"><u>USAGE:</u></h3>
		
		<p align='justify'>Different types of data structures are suited to different kinds of applications, and some are highly specialized to specific tasks. For example, relational databases commonly use B-tree indexes for data retrieval,while compiler implementations usually use hash tables to look up identifiers.</p><br>
		
		<a name = "Implementation">
		<h3 style="color:#32cd32"><u>IMPLEMENTATION:</u></h3>
		
		<p align='justify'>The implementation of a data structure usually requires writing a set of procedures that create and manipulate instances of that structure. The efficiency of a data structure cannot be analyzed separately from those operations. This observation motivates the theoretical concept of an abstract data type, a data structure that is defined indirectly by the operations that may be performed on it, and the mathematical properties of those operations (including their space and time cost).</p><br>

					<dd>A tree whose elements have at most 2 children is called a binary tree. Since each element in a binary tree can have only 2 children, we typically name them the left and right child.</dd>
					<dt>Graphs</dt>
					<dd>A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges. The nodes are sometimes also referred to as vertices and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph.</dd>
					<dt>Graphs</dt>
					<dd>In computer science, a heap is a specialized tree-based data structure which is essentially an almost complete[1] tree that satisfies the heap property: in a max heap, for any given node C, if P is a parent node of C, then the key (the value) of P is greater than or equal to the key of C. In a min heap, the key of P is less than or equal to the key of C. The node at the "top" of the heap (with no parents) is called the root node.</dd>
